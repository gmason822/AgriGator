	  AgriGator is a database system focused on the agricultrual and animal husbandry industries. We aim to ease the strain of data entry and access for mutliple steps of the agricultural process. Our service allows farmers and workers to generate reports based on their location on their property, covering day-to-day farming tasks, fertilization and water use, as well as the type of crop and the eventual yeild of their crop cycle. Our database system allowsbusinesses to harvest more efficiently, by cateloging and tracking all pertinent inputs and yeild information for any crop or commodity. But the benefits to farmers and growers is just one aspect to the value that AgriGator presents.

	  AgriGator's database is organized so that it can act as both a snapshot of current opperations and an extensive catalogue of past events. Data can be organized and indexed on many different levels. We can track all activity in an entire organization, an entire farm, or any given field on that farm (eventually even down to planter boxes). All at the push of a button on an easy to use website and mobile application. Formen will be able to see what has been done in their area of resposibility previously and be more effective in their use of labor. Production supervisors will be able to track the events of their organization with an easy to generate report(which can be organized by many different values), avoiding the hassle of paperwork and data entry into spreadsheets. Inventory can be tracked easily with reduced risk of error.

	  AgriGator's uniformed and easily implimented system can also allow distributers to set standards and best practices for growers, as they are able to trck and quantify what has happened to a crop from planting to shipment. This will also enable an end user to see the source of their purchase.
